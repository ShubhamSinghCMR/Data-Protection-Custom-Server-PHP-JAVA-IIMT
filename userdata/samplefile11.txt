of ??ta??t???? (antarktikos),[8] meaning "opposite to the Arctic", "opposite to the north".[9] Aristotle wrote in his 
book Meteorology about an Antarctic region in c. 350 B.C.[10] Marinus of Tyre reportedly used the name in his unpreserved
 world map from the 2nd century A.D. The Roman authors Hyginus and Apuleius (1-2 centuries A.D.) used for the South Pole
 the romanized Greek name polus antarcticus,[11][12] from which derived the Old French pole antartike (modern pï¿½le antarct
ique) attested in 1270, and from there the Middle English pol antartik in a 1391 technical treatise by Geoffrey Chaucer
 (modern Antarctic Pole).[13] Before acquiring its present geographical connotations, the term was used for other
 locations that could be defined as "opposite to the north". For example, the short-lived French colony established in 
Brazil in the 16th century was called "France Antarctique". The first formal use of the name "Antarctica" as a continental
name in the 1890s is attributed to the Scottish cartographer John George Bartholomew.[14]
